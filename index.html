                    <h3>Google Flights</h3>
                    <p>Google Flights is a flight search engine which lets users search several different 
                        sources according to their needs. It has a wide variety of filters and other useful 
                        flight insights features like price graphs. Once you find the flight you want, Google 
                        Flights will send you to the airline website or other third party booking site
                        to complete the booking. For some specific airlines, Google Flights now allows users 
                        to directly complete their booking without visiting any other sites.</p>
                    <h4>Pros:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flight insights features like price graph which let you see real time price trends.</li>
                        <li>Gives users ability to track prices and get email notifications.</li>
                        <li>A wide variety of filters so you can find exactly what you are looking for.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Cons:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Making effective use of Google Flights might be hard for someone trying it for the 
                        first few times. This is because one may find it hard to make proper use of filters 
                        and flight insights if they have not used these features before.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Skyscanner</h3>
                    <p>Skyscanner is a very popular travel search engine. Just like Google Flights, Skyscanner 
                        is also a powerful search engine which shows results from several airline and third party 
                        websites. However, it also allows users to make booking directly for some specific airlines. 
                        This website is great for travelers with flexibility for example: Skyscanner allows users to 
                        search for cheapest destinations for chosen dates. The website also makes it easy to switch dates 
                        in case if you want to see what prices look like a few days before or after the desired dates of 
                        travel. </p>
                    <h4>Pros:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy to use.</li>
                        <li>Easy to change language and currency.</li>
                        <li>Price tracking features like price alerts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Cons:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No unique features.</li>
                        <li>Barely any information regarding flight insights.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Kayak</h3>
                    <p>Kayak is also a travel search engine like Google Flights and Skyscanner. It has a large number of 
                        different websites that it can compare the prices from for any given flight to help you find the 
                        best fare for whatever class you want to travel. The Hacker Fares might be the reason why you may 
                        prefer to start your search with Kayak as they can truly be a great way to save money. Kayak Hacker 
                        Fares helps you create an itinerary consisting of 2 one-way tickets when it is cheaper than booking 
                        a round trip. The 2 one-way tickets are usually from different airlines. Kayak is unique because 
                        approach like Kayak Hacker Fares is not very common for popular search engines like Kayak.</p>
                    <h4>Pros:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kayak Hacker Fares.</li>
                        <li>Useful price tracking features like price alerts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Cons:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hacker Fares are mostly only useful if you have flexible dates. It is very rare for Hacker Fare 
                            tools to work if you have specific date on mind.</li>
